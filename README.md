# Sentinel delivery suggestion v2

This graphic below shows how I usually deliver a Microsoft Sentinel to most company interested in use Sentinel as a SIEM.

In blue boxes are topics that I usually explain through theory and whiteboarding.

In green boxes are topics that I usually work with a hands-on session on Azure Portal.



NOTE:
As a next step, I will update this graphic to add the links for each topic (boxes).

Graphic also shows the integration with Microsoft Defender for Cloud (MDC) and Microsoft XDR.
